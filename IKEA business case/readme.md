## IKEA business case 

### The case
As a Data Analyst at IKEA you contribute to improving the everyday life of the many people by enabling co-workers and customers to take better actions. In the following case you will be working like you are a Data Analyst in a product team, which will imply that you will have a mixed composition of technical (other Data Analysts or Scientists for instance) and non-technical members (Product Owner or UX Designer). 


### Intro
You are a Data Analyst working as part of a team that is revolutionizing the digital experience of the costumers in IKEA. Among the many task that this implies, your team has developed a new system that allow customers to buy items in a Virtual Reality tour.

After launching it, the team asks you to analyze the data to understand what kind of costumers have tested the new product and what are the main insights that can be obtained.

In this exercise the available dataset contains one day of individual product transactions in a single retail store: item ID, item categorization and sales amount. Furthermore, each transaction is labeled with a specific customer ID as well as supplementary information about that customer, for example whether that customer has children or not.

### Please respond to all the questions below

**Question 1**
<br>
Propose a segmentation analysis and explain the main insights obtained to your team.

**Question 2** 
<br>
What kind of data would you like to have to improve your analysis and back-up the insights that you mentioned?

**Question 3** 
<br>
The team wants to keep developing new features that are personalized for each of the segments that you mentioned with the goal of increasing sales. According to your analysis, what segment should they focus at first?

**Question 4**
<br>
Although the team really appreciated your feedback and insights, since there is a large stock of children items, they are asked to focus the new products on costumers that have children in order to do not waste any of those products.

For some customers, their children status (column “HaveChildren”) is unknown. This is indicated by an empty record instead of a “0” or “1”. 

After some initial data exploration, you determine that it should be possible to predict the missing values / get insights on what characteristics are associated with having kids. 

You decide to attempt to visualize for the team what fields are likely to predict the “HaveChildren” column.

Specifically, generate (and attach to your answer) visualizations, that tells a clear story about what customer characteristics are likely to predict the customers having children.

Include a short synthesis of what insights you draw from your visualizations.
