## What is this repository about?

When I do some works, I would love to share with people and exchange the knowledges, in this case, we can learn from each other
and help each other to improve the coding skills. I put some analytic projects that I have done by using Python in this file, I will love
to see how people put their opinion on it and also you can feel free to take some of my codes as the reference in your works.
